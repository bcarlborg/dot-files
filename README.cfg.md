# Hello
This is a repository containing the dot files that I have invested enough thought and energy into to deem them backup worthy.

This repository uses a slightly unusual git pattern in order to keep my dotfiles in my home directory without needing to initialize a git repo in that directory.

Specifically, it uses the pattern outlined in (this article)[https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles] and clarified in (this article)[https://www.ackama.com/what-we-think/the-best-way-to-store-your-dotfiles-a-bare-git-repository-explained/].
